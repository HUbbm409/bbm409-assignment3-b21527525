### Where do I start?
There are two main scripts; test and train. They are named like that for some reason. Go figure.

### How do I use this?
Try adding -h to main files. It's there for a reason.

### Why so mean?
It's late, I'm sleepy and been busy with same assignment more than 3 weeks and all of my attempts to improve it was futile.
